Routing
==========================
There are two ways to implement routing in AgentScope, both simple and easy to implement:

- Routing by structured output
- Routing by tool calls

.. tip:: Considering there is no unified standard/definition for agent routing, we follow the setting in `Building effective agents <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>`_

Routing by Structured Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By this way, we can directly use the structured output of the agent to determine which agent to route the message to.

Initialize a routing agent

Routing by Tool Calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another way is to wrap the downstream agents into a tool function, so that the routing agent decides which tool to call based on the user query.

We first define several tool functions:

    async def generate_python(demand: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Generate Python code based on the demand.

        return ToolResponse(

        )

    PythonAgent: Here is a simple implementation of the quick sort algorithm in Python. This version chooses the last element as the pivot.

    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr):
        if len(arr) <= 1:
            return arr
        else:
            pivot = arr.pop()
            greater = []
            lower = []

                    lower.append(item)
            return quick_sort(lower) + [pivot] + quick_sort(greater)

    # Example usage:
    # sorted_array = quick_sort([3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1])
    # print(sorted_array)  # Output will be [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]
    ```

    You can use this function to sort a list of numbers. If you want an in-place version or a version that uses a different method for choosing a pivot, let me know and I'll provide that for you.
